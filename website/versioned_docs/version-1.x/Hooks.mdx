Hooks are functions triggered in different ocassions in corde tests executions
All hooks are available bellow:

- [afterAll](/docs/hooks#afterAll)
- [beforeStart](/docs/hooks#beforeStart)

### afterAll(function)

Use `afterAll` to execute something that you want to be executed after all tests run.
A good example of something to be executed after all tests is the logout of your testing
bot.

I.E:

```typescript
afterAll(() => {
  bot.destroy();
});
```

:::note
As corde self make it's bot login, it's make their logout also. So there is no need
to worry about it.
:::

### beforeStart(function)

Use `beforeStart` to execute some function before all tests begin.

This can be, for instance, the login of your bot.

```typescript
beforeStart(async () => {
  await bot.login();
});
```

:::note
In corde tests lifecycle, all these functions are executed **after** corde login, this
bot. Functions to be executed before it will be created future versions of corde.
