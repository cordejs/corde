When testing functionalities with an bot, `expect` will let you define what a bot should do
given a command passed to it. All tests current available in this version(2.0) are listed bellow:

- [command(value)](/docs/expect#expectcommandname-string)
- [not](/docs/expect#not)
- [mustAddReaction(value)](/docs/expect#toaddreactionreaction-string)
- [mustReturn(value)](/docs/expect#toreturn)

:::note
All examples bellow are only to ilustrate the functions called after
`command`. These examples are not used exatly show they are described
in a real use case.

## Reference

### mustReturn(string)

Expect is a function that receives a command as argument. The same argument that you would send to
Discord to invoke some action from your bot. As there is a [prefix](/docs/configurations#botprefix) witch can
be passed in config file, there is no need to pass that prefix in `command` function.

I.E:

Suposing that there is a bot with prefix **!** and that bot has a command called **createAGuild**, you can
use `command` like the example bellow:

```javascript
command("createAGuild");
```

This function returns a several other functions to define what Corde should check after that command be invoke.

:::note
If for some reason you what to pass the bot prefix in `command`, do not use the config variable [prefix](/docs/configuration#botprefix).
:::

### not

Use `not` to deny some test after this keyword. It can be used to check if a operation
made by a bot command is anything but **not** something.

I.E:

```javascript
test("command hello should not return 1", () => {
  command("hello").not.mustReturn(1);
});
```

### mustAddReaction(string | string[])

Use `mustAddReaction` to check if the bot added an reaction or an list of reactions to **the last message sent by someone who is not a bot**.

I.E:

Given a bot who has a command called `addReactions` and add the reactions 😄 and 🍊,
you can write a test like:

```typescript
test("bot should return Hello!!", () => {
  command("addReactions").mustAddReaction("😄", "🍊");
});
```
