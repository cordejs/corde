Hooks are functions triggered in different ocassions in corde tests executions.
Each hook has a timeout parameter which **overrides** the timeout provided in config.
All hooks are available bellow:

- [`afterAll(function, timeout)`](/docs/hooks#afterallfunction-timeout)
- [`afterEach(function, timeout)`](/docs/hooks#aftereachfunction-timeout)
- [`beforeEach(function, timeout)`](/docs/hooks#beforeeachfunction-timeout)
- [`beforeStart(functionm timeout)`](/docs/hooks#beforestartfunction-timeout)

:::note
These functions are valid for all test executions. If you add some of them inside a `group`
or a `test`, corde will not add then to that scope. This feature will be released in the next version of corde.

This means that:

```typescript
group("test groups", () => {
  beforeEeach(() => {
    console.log("I'll back");
  });

  test("test 1", () => {
    expect("hi").toReturn("hello");
  });
});

test("test 2", () => {
  expect("hi").toReturn("hello");
});
```

Will work like:

```typescript
// I'll back
// test 1
// I'll back
// test 2
```

### `afterAll(function, timeout?)`

Use `afterAll` to execute something that you want to be executed after all tests run.

Optionally, you can provide a `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait before aborting.
_Note: The default timeout is 5 seconds._

A good example of something to be executed after all tests are the log out of your testing
bot.

I.E:

```typescript
afterAll(() => {
  bot.destroy();
});
```

:::note
As corde self make its bot login, it makes their logout also. So there is no need
to worry about it.
:::

### `afterEach(function, timeout?)`

Use `afterEach` to execute something after the execution of a test case.

Optionally, you can provide a `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait before aborting.
_Note: The default timeout is 5 seconds._

As mentioned above, this function is not included in clauses like `group` and `test`,
if you call it, this function will be included for all tests (yet).

An exemplification of usage of `afterEach`

```typescript
afterEach(() => {
  console.log("I'm your father");
});

test("test 1", () => {
  expect("hi").toReturn("hello");
});

test("test 2", () => {
  expect("hi").toReturn("hello");
});

// Work like:
// Run test 1
// I'm your father
// Run test 2
// I'm your father
// Done
```

### `beforeEach(function, timeout?)`

Use `beforeEach` to execute something before the operation of each test case.

Optionally, you can provide a `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait before aborting.
_Note: The default timeout is 5 seconds._

```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  console.log("One ring to rule them all");
});

test("test 1", () => {
  expect("hi").toReturn("hello");
});

test("test 2", () => {
  expect("hi").toReturn("hello");
});

// Work like:
// One ring to rule them all
// Run test 1
// One ring to rule them all
// Run test 2
// Done
```

### `beforeStart(function, timeout?)`

Use `beforeStart` to execute some function before all tests begin.

Optionally, you can provide a `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait before aborting.
_Note: The default timeout is 5 seconds._

This can be, for instance, the login of your bot.

```typescript
beforeStart(async () => {
  await bot.login();
});
```

:::note
In corde tests lifecycle, all these functions are executed **after** corde login, this
bot. Functions to be executed before it will be created future versions of corde.
