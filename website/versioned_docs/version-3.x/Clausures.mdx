Corde has some functions to group all tests, are they: `group` and `test`.

- [`group(description, fn)`](/docs/clausures#groupdescription-fn)
- [`test(description, fn, timeout)`](/docs/clausures#testdescription-fn-timeout)

:::note
Both `group` and `test` accept async code, which will be resolved by corde runtime.
:::

### `group(description, fn)`

Also under the alias: `describe(description, fn)`

group(name, fn) creates a block that groups together several related tests.
For instance:

```typescript
group("testing bot", () => {
  test("command 'hi' should  return 'hello'", () => {
    expect("hi").toReturn("hello");
  });

  test("command 'addReaction' should add a reaction to last message", () => {
    expect("hi").toAddReaction(["🍊"]);
  });
});
```

### `test(description, fn, timeout)`

Also under the alias: `it(description, fn, timeout)`

All you need in a test file is the test method which runs a test.
For example, let's take the famous "hi", "hello" test example:

```typescript
test("command 'hi' should  return 'hello'", () => {
  expect("hi").toReturn("hello");
});
```

The first argument is the test name; the second argument is a function that contains the expectations to test.
The third argument (optional) is `timeout` (in milliseconds) for specifying how long to wait before aborting.
Note: The default timeout is 5 seconds.
