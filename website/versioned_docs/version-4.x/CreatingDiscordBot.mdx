To use Corde, there must be two bots in the guild. The first one is your bot, the one that you want to test,
the other is a bot that Corde to communicate with your bot.

The first step to create a bot is to go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications).

After login (if you are not already logged in) you will see a page like the picture below:

![Discord developers home page](/img/discord_developers_home.png)

There, you go to `New Application`. Click that button, you will be prompted to define a name
of the bot, choose a nice name and click `Create`.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

Now that we created an application. Is time to create the real bot entity.
Go to the `Bot` menu on left and click `Add bot`.

It will be prompted to you a note message and you can click in `Yes, do it!`.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![message add bot](/img/message_add_bot.png)

</div>

After clicking on the button, you now have your own `A Great Bot`.

:::note
Each bot has a `token`, it is unique and must be protected. Do not share the token
with other people, or expose it to any source of the internet. If you unintentionally
commit the token to [Github](https://github.com/) for instance, Discord detects it and
invalidates your token. After doing this you will receive a message to you on discord announcing
that security operation. But don't worry, if this happens, you just have to generate a new
token to the bot and make sure to now commit it again ðŸ˜„.
:::

Bot `token` is bot used by [cordeBotToken](/docs/configurations#cordetesttoken). Pay attention about the
usage of each one.

Now that we have the bot and his token, let's add for his [admin permission](/docs/permissions#administrator):
To do that, go to the bottom of the page that we are now and mark the checkbox `Administrator`

Now we are going to mark our bot scope as `bot` and generate a link to add the bot to a server.
Go to `OAuth2` on the left side of the page and mark the checkbox `bot`.

![define bot scope](/img/define_bot_scope.png)

After that, a new field will appear at the bottom with a list of possible permissions
for the bot. Check `Administrator` to allow our bot to have [admin permission](/docs/permissions#administrator)
and copy the link that appears above the permissions block.

![define bot scope](/img/scope_and_permissions.png)

After pasting the generated link and press enter, you will see a prompt asking where to add the bot:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![define bot scope](/img/where_put_bot_prompt.png)

</div>

Choose a server and voilÃ¡, the bot is in your server!

</div>
