Today I'm releasing corde version 3, which has a full rework of its UI,
providing a whole new experience for users, giving them detailed information about errors
on each type of test, as well as a [stack trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace)
of each test if it throws an error.

Take a look on how the output were in version 2:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![old ui](/img/console_print.png)

</div>

And how the UI is now:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

![new ui](/img/test_success_example.png)

</div>

As you can see, there are many changes such as:

- Time track of the execution of the entire cycle of test, of each test file and each test function.
- Display of each test file being executed.
- Summary of which files were executed, how many functions were executed, and how much time it takes.
- A more human-friendly color.

Also, tests are _faster_ because we had a problem with tests verifications

Bellow is a snippet of `toRenameRole` test function:

```typescript
await this.cordeBot.sendTextMessage(this.command);
await wait(600);
role = await this.cordeBot.fetchRole(role.id);
```

The code above is sending the message to Discord and **waiting** a time
to then check if the role was renamed. I don't have to say how terrible
this approach was, but, fortunately, it was rewritten and now, Corde works
fully with [Discord Events](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents).

With that, on each type of test, we wait for the emission of the event.
It is MUCH more secure than the older way, and faster also.
Take a look at how the same test function is now (`toRenameRole`):

```typescript
await this.cordeBot.sendTextMessage(this.command);

let newRole: Role;
try {
  newRole = await this.cordeBot.events.onceRoleRenamed(identifier, this.timeOut);
} catch {
    ...
}
```

As you can see, now instead of waiting a time, and then checking if the role was
renamed (it may not be renamed, in the defined time so, yeah, the test will falsely
fail), we wait until Discord emmit the event of the role being renamed. But as the
test can fail purposefully (or not), we can not wait forever, that is why we have the
timeout parameter, which throws an error if the timeout reaches the informed time
(defined in [configs](/docs/configurations#timeout))
